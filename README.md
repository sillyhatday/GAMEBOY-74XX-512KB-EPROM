# GAMEBOY-FLASHCART-MBC1-DISCRETE
A Gameboy flashcart using discrete logic as a MBC1 replacement

This a tested working flashcart design that was created from a schematic found on the internet. This schematic has been floating around the web since the 90's but I've 
only seen one person try to make a cartridge using that design. This is done with surface mount 74XX series logic that is new and current. I made this to suit want I wanted
as I came across a pile of 64KB EPROMs for free and made a cartridge to use them. Well this is basically an evolution of that using 512KB EPROMs. The EPROMs are no longer made 
as far as I can see, but they are available across eBay and Aliexpress.

The downside of this design is that EPROMs are erased in a UV eraser and programmed in a dedicated programmer. This is a lot less convienient for most people versus something like the GBxCart RW.
The EPROM also does not fit into the cartridge shell, sticking out from the top of the cartridge. I quite like the way the EPROM sticks out from the top of the cartridge, it has a cyberpunk or prototype look to it.

**EPROM**

The EPROM I use is the nice ceramic package 27C040. Very old school look and feel. It is certainly in like with the look and technology of the Gameboy. They are not cheap but also not expensive,
 so you can get a bunch of them in a storage container and switch the EPROM out from the cartridge as you wish. For this reason I reccomend putting the EPROM in a socket.
 Make sure to use a quality chip socket as I've found the connections to be very sensitive to the Gameboy. A quality socket will remove all worry about that.
